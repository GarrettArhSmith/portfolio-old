While I love MongoDB and Express and all the freedoms you get with writing your own back-end, I thoroughly enjoyed using Firebase on this project. Everything was just so darn easy to set up, and Google authentication is a delight. I will definitely be revisiting Firebase in my future projects.`

It started as an internal tool at V School, the bootcamp I graduated from and worked as a TA for. The project evolved so much, at least as far as planning, it took a while for it to get anywhere. There's still not much to it, but I have plans to build out a full-fledged dashboard. I started the project myself with Material UI and designed it for TAs to better track students' progress through the course and keep standup attendance. Later, I joined with some fellow TAs and students to restart and make a bigger tool to be used for many positions behind the scenes at V School. So I built out the dashboard in Material UI again, and later decided to scratch MUI and design it from scratch. Eventually, it was decided to cut the V School project short to allow TAs to focus more attention on student interactions.`

Some basic JWT authentication is in place, with a separate auth page for sign in and sign up. When the user is logged in, the app bar features the user's initials in a clean little bubble that will open an options dropdown when clicked. It's unclear to me what, if anything, this project will become, but I enjoy working on it.`
